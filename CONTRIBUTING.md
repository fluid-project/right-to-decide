## Branches and Pull Requests

The `main` branch contains the production level code that will be published to the production site. Contributions should
first be made to the `dev` branch where they can be deployed to a dev site for further testing. When the `dev` branch is
ready to be pubished to the production site, it should be merged into `main`.
